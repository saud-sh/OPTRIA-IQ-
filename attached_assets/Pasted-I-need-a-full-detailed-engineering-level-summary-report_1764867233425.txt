I need a full, detailed, engineering-level summary report of EVERYTHING you have done so far in the OPTRIA IQ platform.

Please generate a structured, complete, traceable report that covers:

===========================
1) BACKEND CHANGES SUMMARY
===========================
- All files you created or modified
- All API routes added or updated
- Any business logic changes

- How error handling and translation (AR/EN) were updated

============================
3) DATABASE / DATA LAYER
============================
- Confirmation that NO destructive migrations were performed
- Any schema changes (if any) — must be additive-only
- Any new queries, ORM models, or filtering logic added
- Verification that tenant_id isolation is enforced properly

============================
4) INTEGRATION FRAMEWORK
============================
- How PI, SAP, OPC-UA, and external DB placeholders were implemented

- Details on “Test Connection” endpoints (if implemented)
- How DEMO_MODE affects integration calls

============================
5) OPTIMIZATION ENGINE

============================
6) SECURITY, AUTH & RBAC
============================
- Any changes to authorization/role logic
- Any security patches applied
- Confirmation that JWT/session logic works correctly

============================
7) SMOKE TESTS / INTERNAL CHECKS
============================
- Did you create the end-to-end smoke test script?
- What exactly does it test?
- Did all CRUD operations pass?
- Any failures or warnings?

- Did you create the `/internal/config/status` endpoint?
- What subsystems does it check?

============================
8) SYSTEM HEALTH VERIFICATION
============================
Please confirm the status of:
- DB connection
- Background jobs
- Optimization runners
- AI module readiness
- Template rendering engine
- Owner/Tenant UI flow
- Multi-language support

============================
9) WHAT IS STILL MISSING
============================
Provide a *bullet-point list* of:
- Any remaining required work
- Any TODOs inside the codebase
- Any warnings or potential breakpoints
- Anything the platform owner (me) must manually provide (e.g., real PI credentials, SAP tokens, etc.)

============================
10) FINAL READINESS VERDICT
============================
Finally, provide:

- A clear assessment:  
  ✔ Ready for production  
  OR  
  ❌ Requires fixes  

- With **specific reasons** for your verdict.

============================

IMPORTANT:
The summary must be extremely detailed, including filenames, affected functions, and a clear explanation of why each modification was performed.
