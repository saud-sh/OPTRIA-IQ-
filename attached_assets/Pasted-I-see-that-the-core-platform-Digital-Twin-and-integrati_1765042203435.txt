I see that the core platform, Digital Twin, and integrations are working and the smoke tests are green, but the Industrial Black Box UI is still empty (no incidents/events for the ARAMCO_DEMO tenant).

I need you to add a non-destructive demo seeding layer specifically for the Black Box, without touching existing production-safe logic. Please do the following:

Black Box Demo Seeder

Create a function like seed_blackbox_demo_data(tenant_code="ARAMCO_DEMO") that:

Finds the ARAMCO_DEMO tenant (or returns if not found).

Picks 3–5 existing demo assets for that tenant.

Inserts a small set of BlackBoxIncident records for this tenant (e.g. pump trip, high vibration, high temperature).

For each incident, inserts 20–50 related events in the Black Box event table (whatever table you use internally: sensor readings, alerts, work orders, operator actions).

Make sure every new record has tenant_id set correctly.

Call this seeder only when:

APP_ENV = "development"

DEMO_MODE = true

And data is not already present (idempotent: don’t duplicate incidents on every startup).

Wire the “تشغيل الكشف / Run Detection” button

On the Black Box landing page, the top button says “تشغيل الكشف” (Run Detection).

Make sure clicking this button:

Triggers either:

a) a background job that scans recent alerts / sensor anomalies and creates incidents, or

b) in DEMO_MODE, simply calls seed_blackbox_demo_data again to refresh the sample incidents.

Returns a clear success/error message in the UI (toast or inline).

Minimal Timeline Endpoint

Expose a simple read-only API to support the UI later:

GET /api/blackbox/incidents → list of incidents for the current tenant

GET /api/blackbox/incidents/{id}/events → ordered list of events (by timestamp) for that incident

Ensure:

tenant isolation via tenant_id filter

RBAC decorators (require_tenant_access) are applied

No secrets or sensitive config are leaked in responses.

Verification

After implementing:

Run the existing smoke tests.

Add a very small check in integration_smoke_test.py that:

Logs in as demo@aramco.com

Calls /api/blackbox/incidents

Confirms that at least 1 incident is returned for ARAMCO_DEMO.

Confirm that in the UI:

Logging in as demo@aramco.com and opening the Black Box page shows several demo incidents with different severities.

Please keep everything additive, tenant-safe, and development-only for the seeding logic. Do not remove or refactor existing Black Box code – just add the seeding and API endpoints required to make the UI actually show demo incidents.
